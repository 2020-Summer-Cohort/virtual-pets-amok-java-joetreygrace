# Virtual Pet Shelter

I made my Virtual Pet Shelter Amok using TDD. I started by using some code from my Pet Shelter project and refactoring it to match this project. I then made abstract pet classes to help my 4 different kind of virtual pets.

Next I made my Shelter Class again. It was almost identical to the Shelter class on my last project. With a few added methods using instanceof to only apply to different kinds of virtual pets.

My APP class works on a while loop that is always true until the user decides to quit which breaks the loop. In the APP you have option to feed and water organic pets, oil robotic pets, walk all dogs, play with all cats, adopt a pet and add a pet to the shelter.
